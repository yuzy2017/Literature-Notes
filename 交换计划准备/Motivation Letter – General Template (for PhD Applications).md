### **Motivation Letter for PhD Application**

Dear Prof. [Last Name] / Dear Admissions Committee,

I am writing to express my strong interest in pursuing a PhD position at [University or Group Name], focusing on integrated photonics and nonlinear optics. With a background in experimental nanophotonics and hands-on experience in thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) devices, I am eager to contribute to cutting-edge research in your group and further develop my academic career.

During my Master's research at ETH Zurich (under the supervision of Prof. Juerg Leuthold), I was introduced to integrated photonic devices and their applications in signal processing. Building upon that foundation, I am now conducting research in nonlinear photonics at the National University of Singapore, focusing on the design, fabrication, and testing of TFLN-based EO modulators, frequency combs, and wavelength conversion devices. This work has equipped me with solid expertise in on-chip optical design, nanofabrication process flow, and optical measurement.

Beyond hands-on device development, I have also been involved in numerical simulation projects related to quantum wells and electromagnetic field modeling, which broadened my perspective on photonic system design and theoretical modeling.

I am particularly interested in your group‚Äôs work on [üîÅ**Insert research theme / paper**], which aligns well with my interests in [e.g., nonlinear integrated devices, quantum light sources, photonic computing, etc.]. I believe that your problem-driven approach and commitment to both fundamental understanding and real-world applications would provide an ideal environment for me to grow as a researcher.

In the long term, I hope to contribute to the advancement of integrated photonic platforms for quantum optics or high-speed signal processing. I am especially excited about exploring the intersection between material engineering, chip-scale integration, and nonlinear dynamics.

Thank you very much for considering my application. I would be honored to join your team and contribute to the exciting research being carried out at [University Name]. Please find my CV attached for your reference, and I would be happy to provide any additional information if needed.

Sincerely,  
Zhuoyang Yu
