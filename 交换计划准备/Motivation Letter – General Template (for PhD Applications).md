### **Motivation Letter for PhD Application**

Dear Prof. Cristina Benea,

I am writing to apply for a PhD position in Hybrid Photonics Lab at EPFL. My current work in nonlinear integrated photonics, especially on thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) platforms, aligns closely with your group’s vision of merging integrated nanophotonics with ultrafast quantum and terahertz photonics. I am particularly fascinated by the project of integrated photonic-spintronic devices.

During my current PhD at the National University of Singapore I have been working on chi2 frequency combs based on TFLN. I have gained extensive experience in nanofabrication (e-beam lithography, dry etching, periodic poling), SHG characterization and numerical modeling for comb generation. These skills equip me well to contribute to your lab's mission, especially in designing high Q optical resonator, high speed EO combs and nonlinear integrated devices for THz generation and detection.

Beyond hands-on device development, I have also engaged in computational projects involving photonic and quantum semiconductor systems. During my Master’s studies at ETH Zurich, I solved the multiband k.p model for III-V quantum wells, which deepened my understanding of quantum mechanics and band structure engineering. This experience broadened my theoretical foundation and cultivated a long-term interest in quantum photonics and light–matter interaction at the quantum level.

I am particularly interested in your group’s work combining device-level innovation with deeper physical application. In the short term, I will spend more time in the lab to solid my experiment techniques and also learn your group's ultrafast measurement setups. I hope I can finish one or two small publishable projects in the first two years with solid basic experiment techniques and view of the THz field.  In the long term, I hope to contribute to the advancement of integrated photonic platforms for quantum sensing or high-speed communication with THz. 

Thank you very much for considering my application. I would be honored to join your team and contribute to the exciting research being carried out at EPFL. Please find my CV attached for your reference, and I would be happy to provide any additional information if needed.

Sincerely,  
Zhuoyang Yu
