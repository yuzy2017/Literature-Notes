Dear Prof. [PI's Last Name],

I hope this message finds you well. My name is Zhuoyang Yu, and I got my master degree in ETH Zurich and currently pursuing my PhD in NUS working with nonlinear optics with lithium niobate. I came across your group’s work on [🔁**Step 1: 提到对方代表作/方向**] and found it deeply inspiring.

My current research focuses on nonlinear photonics using thin-film lithium niobate, including applications in EO modulators, frequency combs, and frequency conversion. This work has allowed me to gain solid experience in nanofabrication, on-chip optical design, and sample characterization. Many of the skills I have developed — from process flow planning to measurement and data analysis — could be directly related to the research directions in your group, such as [ **他们的研究方向**].

In addition, I have previously worked on quantum well simulation and electromagnetic field modeling, which has further strengthened my background in numerical simulation and device analysis.

[🔁**Step 2: 结合你理解谈谈他们的工作**]  
I’ve been particularly interested in your recent paper on [paper title / topic], especially the way you [e.g. "engineered the cavity dispersion to enable broadband photon generation" or "combined EO modulation with nonclassical light sources"]. I believe this approach is not only elegant but also highly relevant to scalable quantum photonic integration.

[🔁**Step 3: 提出申请动机 + 合作意愿**]  可能方向有用 什么的
I’m very interested in the possibility of pursuing a PhD opportunity in your group, and I would be grateful if you would consider me for any upcoming openings. I would be happy to share more information or discuss potential alignment in more detail.

Thank you very much for your time and consideration. I truly admire the work being done in your group and hope to have the chance to contribute.

Warm regards,  
Zhuoyang Yu
