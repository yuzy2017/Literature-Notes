Dear Prof Leuthold,

I hope this message finds you well. I am Zhuoyang your previous master student. This might be a bit unexpected and I have been thinking about it for some time and wanted to share it with you honestly.

When I applied for PhD positions last year after finishing the master project with Killian, I was grateful and honored to be offered the oppotunity.  At that time, I felt uncertain about changing my direction to memresitor and work with nanofab-related projects. Therefore, I tried to look for some traditional materials to see if I can focus on the design and applications.

After spending more than half a year in Singapore and going through actual fabrication work for several times. I realized I do not dislike it as much as I thought. In fact, I started to see the value and satisfaction in building and optimizing something hands-on. Also, being in a group where threre is little communication and overlapping topics make me miss the kind of environment you had built. 

As I still want to pursue an academic career, I want to ask -- if there is still any possibility, would you consider letting me return your group to work as a PhD candidate? I completely understand that this is a big ask, especially since I left earlier. But I have thought this though carefully, and I believe I would be much more motivated and grounded if I could have the chance to start again under your guidance. In Singapore, I focus on nonlinear photnics on thin film lithium niobate, including ring resonator, EO modulator and frequency combs. I put my results in the slides attached to this email.

Of course, I would be happy to chat more if you are open to it, and I would really appreciate your honest thoughts.

Thanks a lot for reading this and for everything you have already done for me.

Best Regards,
Zhuoyang Yu
