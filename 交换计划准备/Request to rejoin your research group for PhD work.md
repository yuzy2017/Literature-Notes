Dear Prof Leuthold,

I hope this message finds you well. I am Zhuoyang your previous master student. This might be a bit unexpected and I have been thinking about it for some time and wanted to share it with you honestly.

When I applied for PhD positions last year after finishing the master project with Killian, I was grateful and honored to be offered the oppotunity.  At that time, I felt uncertain about changing my direction to memresitor and work with nanofab-related projects. Therefore, I tried to look for some traditional materials to see if I can focus on the design and applications.

After spending more than half a year in Singapore and going through actual fabrication work for several times. I realized I do not dislike it as much as I thought. In fact, I started to see the value and satisfaction in building and optimizing something hands-on. Also, being in a group where threre is little communication and overlapping topics make me miss the kind of environment you had built. 

As I still want to pursue an academic career, I want to ask -- if there is still any possibility, would you consider letting me return your group to work as a PhD candidate? I completely understand that this is a big ask, especially since I left earlier. But I have thought this though carefully, and I believe I would be much more motivated and grounded if I could have the chance to start again under your guidance. In Singapore, I focus on nonlinear photnics on thin film lithium niobate, including ring resonator, EO modulator and frequency combs. I put my results in the slides attached to this email.

Of course, I would be happy to chat more if you are open to it, and I would really appreciate your honest thoughts.

Thanks a lot for reading this and for everything you have already done for me.

Best Regards,
Zhuoyang Yu


Dear Prof. Leuthold,

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to follow up on the email I sent a couple of weeks ago regarding the possibility of rejoining your group as a PhD student. I completely understand that you may have been busy with travel and other tasks recently, and I appreciate your time.

My current work in nonlinear photnics on thin-film lithium niobate including applications in EO modulators, frequency combs and frequency conversion. This has helped me develop solid experience in nanofabrication. sample testing and optical design on chip. Many of the skills I have developed --- from process flow planning to measurement and data analysis --- could be directly related to research directions in your group like BTO or memristor based photon source.

Furthermore, I am very energetic and motivated to work in your group to focus on scientific research and daily problem solving. 

I also understand that your group’s PhD plans may already be settled this year. If it’s more feasible from your side, I would also be open to starting as a short-term research assistant, to gradually integrate into ongoing work and prove my commitment in action.

I've attached a short summary slide with some of the recent work I've done in Singapore, in case it's helpful for you to get a sense of my current background.

Thank you again for your time and for all your past support. Regardless of the outcome, I remain deeply grateful for the experience I had in your group.

Warm regards,  
Zhuoyang
