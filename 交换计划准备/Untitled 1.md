Dear Prof Van der Sande,

I am very excited to reach out and applying for the PhD position in *Applied Physics, Neuromorphic Photonics and Ising Machines*, at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel. With a solid background in integrated photonics and nonlinear optics, I am particularly drawn to your innovative approach in designing photonic hardware accelerators based on Ising models, and I am highly motivated to contribute to this frontier research.

Currently, I am a PhD researcher at the National University of Singapore, working on second-order nonlinear optical frequency combs based on thin-film lithium niobate microresonators. My work involves both nanofabrication and numerical modeling of integrated photonic devices, including the engineering of dispersion, coupling, and cavity dynamics to generate soliton and study the mechanisms of multi-mode interactions. This research has equipped me with a strong command of photonic device simulation, high-Q microcavity design, and nonlinear wave propagation—skills that are directly transferable to the challenges posed by photonic Ising machines.

Prior to this, I completed my MSc at ETH Zurich, where I worked on III-V quantum well simulations and developed a solid knowledge about numerical modelling. Over the past years, I have become increasingly fascinated by photonic computing, particularly its potential to overcome the energy bottlenecks of classical hardware through analog, parallel processing. The opportunity to work with VUB and UGENT on photonic implementations of Ising solvers—balancing theory, design, and experimental validation—is exactly the kind of interdisciplinary and high-impact project I seek.

What attracts me especially to this position is its emphasis on **co-supervision, international exchange**, and the potential for **cotutelle**. I am eager to be part of a vibrant collaborative ecosystem that spans institutions and scientific domains. I believe my experience working across both simulation and experimental platforms will allow me to contribute meaningfully to the project from day one—whether that be in modeling dynamical systems for optimization, designing photonic circuits, or assisting in the experimental realization of Ising solvers.

Thank you very much for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how I may contribute to your research group.

Yours sincerely,
Zhuoyang Yu
