Dear Dr. Min Wan and members of the committee,

I am writing to express my keen interest in the PhD position on **Photonic Integrated Circuit (PIC)-based Terahertz Transmitters for Imaging**, recently advertised by the Eindhoven University of Technology. With an academic and research background in integrated photonics, nonlinear optics, and optical system modeling, I am enthusiastic about contributing to your ambitious effort toward compact, high-performance THz imaging systems within the PhotonDelta framework.

Currently, I am conducting doctoral research at the National University of Singapore, where I focus on second-order nonlinear frequency combs based on lithium niobate microresonators. My work spans the **design, simulation, and fabrication** of integrated optical systems that require careful control of phase matching, dispersion, and coupling mechanisms. In this context, I have developed a strong command of **optical wave propagation**, **high-frequency modeling**, and **nanophotonic integration**—all highly relevant to the proposed THz system design based on PICs.

My prior Master’s studies at **ETH Zurich** gave me foundational experience in semiconductor quantum optics and optoelectronic device simulation, including the use of photonic design tools and modeling of high-speed devices. Across both degrees, I have gained hands-on familiarity with **cleanroom fabrication**, **PIC simulation environments** (e.g., Lumerical, COMSOL), and **system-level integration**, as well as a multidisciplinary perspective that aligns well with the cross-cutting nature of this THz transmitter project.

What particularly excites me about this PhD opportunity is the emphasis on **packaged transmitter development**, **beam steering and focusing**, and the **real-world applications** in sensing and imaging. I am deeply motivated by the chance to contribute to an applied project with immediate industrial relevance while pushing the fundamental frontiers of high-frequency photonic integration. I am also eager to work within the collaborative ecosystem of the PhotonDelta program and contribute actively to the Dutch integrated photonics roadmap.

I bring to the role strong problem-solving ability, a self-driven research attitude, and a genuine passion for experimental and system-level photonics. I also enjoy mentoring and teaching, having guided undergraduate students during my current program. I would welcome the opportunity to contribute to TU/e’s vibrant research environment and to grow under the guidance of your team.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to further discuss how my background and enthusiasm can contribute to the success of your research program.

Yours sincerely,  
**Zhuoyang Yu**
