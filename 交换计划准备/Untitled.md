**Dear Prof. Wim Bogaerts,**

I am writing to apply for a PhD position in your group at Ghent University. My background in integrated photonics, especially my current work on chi2 frequency combs on thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN), as well as my previous modeling experience in III-V quantum wells, aligns well with your group’s research in programmable photonic circuits, silicon photonics, and photonic design automation.

During my current PhD at the National University of Singapore, I have been working on chi2-based frequency combs using TFLN. This has given me extensive experience in nanofabrication (e-beam lithography, dry etching, periodic poling), second-harmonic generation characterization, and numerical modeling of nonlinear optical systems. I believe these skills are transferable to developing reconfigurable photonic platforms, as they demand precise fabrication, system-level understanding, and robust optical testing.

Beyond experimental work, I also have experience in theoretical and computational modeling of semiconductor photonic systems. During my Master’s at ETH Zurich, I solved the multiband **k·p** model for III-V quantum wells, which strengthened my understanding of quantum mechanics and electronic band structures. This background equips me to contribute not only to experimental tasks but also to modeling and simulation of photonic components.

In the short term, I hope to contribute to your group’s work on programmable photonic circuits, especially in the co-design of physical devices and high-level control architectures. In the longer term, I aspire to help bridge the gap between device-level photonics and scalable system-level applications by integrating concepts from nonlinear optics and design automation.

Thank you for considering my application. I would be honored to join your group and contribute to its pioneering work in reconfigurable photonics. My CV is attached, and I would be happy to provide further information.

Sincerely,
