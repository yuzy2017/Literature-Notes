### 🌟 What is novel or interesting about this work?
- Technical innovations
Doing transducer directly with EO effects, with AlN which have a high thermal conductivity and CMOS compatable. Then Triple resonance geometry
- Compared to prior work, what’s new?
- material system different combine SSBM and AOM

### 📌 Connections to Gong Zheng’s PhD thesis
- Which chapter does this relate to?
- Is this part of a larger research trajectory?
- just an application of Chi2 effects of AlN not sure

### 💡 My thoughts & extensions
- Can I use this technique/idea?
- LN have larger chi2 but smaller thermal conductivity, so I need to think about how to mitigate the thermal may be with other material maybe with lower power
- 是否可以考虑 TE–TM 模态差结构在 LN 上实现类似三模共振？虽然热导低，但通过低功率和异质集成缓解？
- How could I adapt this concept to my experiment or simulation?
-The theory about EO transducer
- What are my questions after reading?

   最后总结
   This paper demonstrates a highly integrated, coherent, and bidirectional microwave-optical converter based on EO effect in AlN. The novel use of TE/TM mode splitting for triple-resonance significantly improves the coupling efficiency and scalability. Its combination of CMOS-compatibility, cryo-compatibility, and high Q optical cavity makes it a promising platform for future hybrid quantum systems.
