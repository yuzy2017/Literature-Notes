### 🔍 What problem does this paper address?
- Briefly summarize the motivation and background.
- In AlN the optical thermal effect is strong, it will unstablize the soliton formation. To avoid this they ultilize SSBM and OAM to fast tune the pump wavelength and power to get the soliton state avoid the thermal instability region.

### 🧪 What are the key methods or experimental techniques?
- Experimental setup / materials used

- Theoretical model (if any)
- no expression is thermal will push the resonance to the red-detuned side and 
- Key parameters or system
   frequency and power tuning rate the overtune rate the power increase rate]
   cavity wavelength $\lambda_c$,  frequency sweep speed,  back $\delta_{back}$ $\tau_{back}$, pump power, power increase factor
### 📈 What are the main results?
- What does the paper demonstrate?
- demonstate a programe to trap the field in cavity in the soliton state with a probability of 99.4%
- Any key figures (Fig. X) to note

### 🌟 What is novel or interesting about this work?
- Technical innovations
- frequency and power sweep program with 1 over detune and back sweep 2 
- Compared to prior work, what’s new?
- material system different combine SSBM and AOM

### 📌 Connections to Gong Zheng’s PhD thesis
- Which chapter does this relate to?
- chapter 2
- Is this part of a larger research trajectory?
- yes they then study chi2 soliton in AlN cavity and LN

### 💡 My thoughts & extensions
- Can I use this technique/idea?
- yes try to check the bidirectional soliton paper to solve the photorefractive problem
- How could I adapt this concept to my experiment or simulation?
- the fast scan can help us understand that the formation of comb is faster can be formed in a few nanosecond
- What are my questions after reading?s
- 对于LN 是否已经有稳定的soliton 观察到？？？是否需要延长寿命？？？
