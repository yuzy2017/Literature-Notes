Subject: A Personal Update and a Small Favor


I wanted to thank you again for helping me earlier when I was exploring the possibility of a joint PhD setup — I truly appreciated your support back then. I understand it probably wasn’t the easiest situation, especially with all the back-and-forth from my side, and I’m sorry for any trouble that might have caused.

Over the past month, I’ve had time to reflect more deeply. After pushing my current project for a month, I have come to realize that I truly value the research directions and working atmosphere in ETH. More importantly, I feel much more grounded now — I’ve learned to take ownership of my decisions, manage my expectations better, and stay committed to pushing things forward even when it’s hard.

This time, I’ve made up my mind for real — I recently wrote to Prof. Leuthold expressing my sincere wish to return to the group for PhD work.

I understand the situation is far from simple, and I don’t take anything for granted. But I wanted to ask: if you feel it’s appropriate and if there’s a good moment, would you be willing to mention to Prof. Leuthold that I’ve reached out again — and that this time, I’m coming from a much more mature, steady place, ready to commit long-term and contribute meaningfully?

It would really mean a lot to me, even if it’s just a small word at the right time. Of course, no pressure at all — I totally understand if it’s not convenient.

Thanks again for all your help. I genuinely admire the work you guys are doing, and I’d be really grateful for any support you can offer.

Warm regards,
